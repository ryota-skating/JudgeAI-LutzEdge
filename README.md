# Introduction

This is the official code for "Automatic Edge Error Judgment in Figure Skating Using 3D Pose Estimation from a Monocular Camera and IMUs".

# Datasets

You can download the IMU dataset as CSV files from `IMU_data/dataset` and video data from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WzERNs04uo_5xjybfKcXYOC9v8KL6Hk2?usp=drive_link).
Video data are pre-processed so that only the skaters are cut out from the bounding box, and the timing of the de-ice is aligned.
